# UniversityApp System Analysis Course June 2020.
In this application I built a centralised system where students of a university could access their timetable, add and drop classes, add friends to their friends list, view details about courses on their courselist,etc.
The name of the database schema is universityapp, I have included it in  a .sql file with the same name in the project folder.I have included 9 students/users in the database. In order to login and start the project their credentials are :
1000->admin,
1001->admin,
1002->admin,
1003->admin,
1004->admin,
1005->steven
1006->oliver
1007->anna
1008->willy.

The main class that starts the project is LogIN in the GUI package. For the way how the system should be used and the functionalities of each button, I have included a HELP window in a  menu strip in the MAIN WINDOW that opens after the LOG IN.
